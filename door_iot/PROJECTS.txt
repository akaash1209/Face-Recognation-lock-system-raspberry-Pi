1.Face Recognition Door Lock System
In This project,I had built a door unlocking system using a face-recognition system
 as a password
-Data Gathering
-Training
-Face Recognition
--In the first phase, we will collect the face samples that are authorized to open
 the lock. 
--In the second phase, we will train the data for recognization.
--In the last phase, trainer data will be used to recognize the faces.
 If raspberry pi recognizes a face, it will open the door lock.

2.IoT based drawer locker
--In this project,I have build an IOT BASED DRAWER LOCKING SYSTEM using esp module,
solonoid lock,relay and adafruit IO.Here esp will acts as the main controller and 
connects the user to the drawer lock system.This allows the user to lock and unlock
his drawer by using smartphone from anywhere
